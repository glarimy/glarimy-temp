            In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
            released NCSA Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the
            growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years
            earlier. In 1994, a company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California and employed
            many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code
            with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for "Mosaic killer",
            as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world's number one web browser. The first version of
            the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters
            of the browser market and became the main web browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with
            the NCSA, the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and the company took the
            name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc
            Andreessen, the founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web
            designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be
            written directly in the Web page markup. In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal
            of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.[14] Before he could get started, Netscape
            Communications collaborated with Sun Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming
            language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms.[15] Netscape
            Communications then decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should
            have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend
            the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days,
            in May 1995. Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when
            it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript[2]
            when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.[16] The final choice of name caused confusion,
            giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been
            characterized[17] as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new
            Web programming language. There is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an earlier Web page
            scripting language developed by Nombas named Cmm (not to be confused with the later C-- created in 1997).[18][19]
            Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript.[20] Nombas did pitch their embedded
            Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by the ViolaWWW Web
            browser.[21] Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of Cmm in their ScriptEase product and was
            part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.[22] </div>

            when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.[16] The final choice of name caused confusion,
            giving the impression that the language was a spin-off of the Java programming language, and the choice has been
            characterized[17] as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new
            Web programming language. There is a common misconception that JavaScript was influenced by an earlier Web page
            scripting language developed by Nombas named Cmm (not to be confused with the later C-- created in 1997).[18][19]
            Brendan Eich, however, had never heard of Cmm before he created LiveScript.[20] Nombas did pitch their embedded
            Web page scripting to Netscape, though Web page scripting was not a new concept, as shown by the ViolaWWW Web
            browser.[21] Nombas later switched to offering JavaScript instead of Cmm in their ScriptEase product and was
            part of the TC39 group that standardized ECMAScript.[22]

            <h1> Fifth Division </h1>
            In 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), a unit of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
            released NCSA Mosaic, the first popular graphical Web browser, which played an important part in expanding the
            growth of the nascent World Wide Web beyond the NeXTSTEP niche where the WorldWideWeb had formed three years
            earlier. In 1994, a company called Mosaic Communications was founded in Mountain View, California and employed
            many of the original NCSA Mosaic authors to create Mosaic Netscape. However, it intentionally shared no code
            with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, which stood for "Mosaic killer",
            as the company's goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world's number one web browser. The first version of
            the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters
            of the browser market and became the main web browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with
            the NCSA, the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and the company took the
            name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc
            Andreessen, the founder of the company believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web
            designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be
            written directly in the Web page markup. In 1995, Netscape Communications recruited Brendan Eich with the goal
            of embedding the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator.[14] Before he could get started, Netscape
            Communications collaborated with Sun Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun's more static programming
            language Java, in order to compete with Microsoft for user adoption of Web technologies and platforms.[15] Netscape
            Communications then decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would complement Java and should
            have a similar syntax, which excluded adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To defend
            the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days,
            in May 1995. Although it was developed under the name Mocha, the language was officially called LiveScript when
            it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript[2]
            when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.[16] The final choice of name caused confusion,
