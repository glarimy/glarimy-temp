USER GUIDE

This component spies on the scrolling across various elements in a given container.
The bar on the top of the page displays the current element being scrolled.
There is no limit on the number of elements in the container.

USAGE:
0. Include the stylesheet 'surekha.css' and javascript library 'surekha.js' in to the header. This component depends on JQuery, hence add it as well.
1. Create an empty DIV element with id 's-spy'. This element displays the scroll status.
2. Wrap the elements to be scrolled with a parent DIV with id 's-container'. Make sure every scrollable element is having an id.
3. Call the function spy() after the document load.
4. And that's it. Watch the fun by scrolling the document up and down.
